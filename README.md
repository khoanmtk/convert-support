# Convert Support

Multiple tool for convert file

## md-to-enex.py

Convert from markdown to Evernote format.

I use vs roam and obsidian to manage my knowledge. But I have problem when fast access it by phone.
Evernote is good at searching and support multi platform. 
Therefore I convert the md to enex, and import it to Evernote to backup, fast access and searching
This script use for that.

Time creation will be the time that run script, the author was default as me, you need customize below code before use it
``` python
    # You may need to change to author to you
    author = "Khoan"
```
